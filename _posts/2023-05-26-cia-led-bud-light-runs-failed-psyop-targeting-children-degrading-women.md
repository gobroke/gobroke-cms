Psychological operations (PSYOP) have long been a part of intelligence strategies, shaping narratives and perceptions to achieve strategic objectives. While the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) has been associated with such operations, claims about the CIA placing individuals in CEO positions to execute psychological operations warrant further exploration. Let us shed light on the dynamics between intelligence agencies and corporate leadership.

CEO of Anhueser-Busch Brendan Whitworth worked as an "Operations Officer" for the Central Intelligence Agency from 2001-2006, "quit" and worked on his MBA from Harvard from 2006-2008, and immediately after graduation became Senior Director of Sales at Frito-Lay (PepsiCo). Later becoming CEO of Anhueser-Busch which owns Bud Light, and the Beer Institute's (beer industry's self-regulatory body) Chairman and Senior director.

Alissa Heinerschneid, Bud Lights VP of marketing, had a "super clear mandate" taken the responsibility for this campaign wants "young drinkers" (most of Dylans fans are teenagers) to be exposed to sexually charged material to be more "inclusive".

"Bud Light had been a brand of fratty out of touch humor" - let's replace this with a mentally ill man who dresses up like a woman to get likes on tiktok from kids.

Alissa Heinerscheid, who oversaw Bud Light marketing, and her boss Daniel Blake were placed on leave. The CEO stays because his mandate to protect national security includes pushing sexual content to children while encouraging them to drink alcohol. I would not let kids be around him after he's had a few beers.

Some politicians question the role Brendan had played in this, and if this PSYOP violated their own code of conduct around marketing alcohol to children:

> Texas Senator Ted Cruz and Tennessee Senator Marsha Blackburn sent a joint letter to Anheuser-Busch CEO and Beer Institute Chairman Brendan Whitworth asking the Beer Institute's Code Compliance Review Board to investigate Bud Light's partnership with Mulvaney over concerns that the company violated the Beer Institute's advertising code by allegedly marketing its products to minors, [Fox News reports](https://www.foxnews.com/media/sen-ted-cruz-calls-probe-bud-light-dylan-mulvaney-ad-campaign-marketing-children).

Some choice quotes from this report:

> Dylan Mulvaney lip-syncing “I am Eloise, I am six” while dressed as a small child. This video gathered 7.1 million views. It aired thirteen days before the Bud Light partnership.
>
> An objective survey of Dylan Mulvaney’s content clearly presents a faux, pre-pubescent girl persona that is created and presented to specifically appeal to young viewers.
>
> The Mulvaney/Bud Light campaign is starkly similar to the discredited and now illegal marketing campaigns of cigarette manufacturers that used youth-favored advertising tools such as “Joe Camel” in an attempt to develop early brand loyalty with children who were legally prohibited from smoking cigarettes.

While many, myself included, think the infantilization of american youth is extreme in its effects (I have no problem with responsible young adults having some beer before the age of 21), it is quite peculiar to encourage it when paired with sexually charged material of a perverted kind. If youth is drinking beer, they should get as far away from these people as people. Just get the hell away. Do not drink CIA beer, and do not be drunk around people whose entire identity is sexually based.

Whoever has a shred of decency should demand Anhueser-Busch relinquish itself from CIA influence and fire anyone involved with the campaigns encouraging young people to drink beer with creepy men who dress up like women. If the company is unable to right itself in its entirety it should fail, one has to wonder how something which used to be an iconic brand has fallen so far. Probably a coincidence.
