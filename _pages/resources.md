Consider using the hashtag #GoBroke in twitter posts. Follow and amplify others doing the same <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23gobroke&f=live" target="_blank">here</a>.
</p>

<h6>Email</h6>

<p>Consider writing emails to companies and their executive teams. If they are acting in a way that they know to be deleterious to their shareholders, it is a breach of their fiduciary duties, and a breach of public trust and reputation.

<strong>subject: Offensive marketing leading to boycott of Company</strong>

<br>

<p>
Dear [Corporate Representative/Company Name],
</p>

<p>
I am writing to express my deep disappointment as a former loyal customer of your company. I have made the decision that my household will no longer purchase your products/services due to your embrace of woke ideology. The blatant prioritization of political correctness over core business principles has led to a disconnect between your company and its once-loyal customer base. As a result, I have been compelled to join others in boycotting your brand.
</p>

<p>
I strongly urge you to reflect on the negative consequences of embracing woke ideology and consider making strategic changes. In particular, I recommend a thorough evaluation of your marketing teams. It is evident that the current marketing strategies and messaging fail to resonate with a significant portion of your customer base. Reevaluating and revamping your marketing teams may help realign your strategies with the desires and values of your customers, rebuilding the trust and loyalty that has been lost.
</p>

<p>
It is crucial for businesses to prioritize the interests and values of their customers rather than succumbing to divisive narratives. By taking proactive steps to address this issue and refocusing on customer-centric approaches, you have an opportunity to restore faith in your brand and regain the support of your previously loyal customer base.
</p>

<p>
Thank you for taking the time to consider my concerns and recommendations. I sincerely hope that you will take decisive action to address these issues and steer your company back toward a path of success.
</p>

<p>
Sincerely,
</p>

<p>
[Your Name]
</p>
